                        <p>
                            Hi! I am a Munich based Data Scientist with a research background
                            in astrophysics and particle physics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am an experienced software developer with a preference for Python.                            
                            I currently work on developing and exploring state-of-the-art algorithms
                            to solve real-world challenges for the Energy Transition. My technical skills are in the fields of 
                            Time Series Forecasting, Anomaly Detection, Optimization, Physical Modeling, and Scenario Simulation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After graduating from the University of Trieste (Italy) with a master's degree
                            in particle physics, I moved to the Technical University of Munich to pursue my
                            PhD in astrophysics. My main scientific interest was to investigate the origin of
                            astrophysical neutrinos using the data from the South Pole IceCube Neutrino
                            Observatory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am currently working as Data Scientist at OmegaLambdaTec, a company that provides
                            pioneering AI-powered sustainability solutions.
