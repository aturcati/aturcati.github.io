                    <p>
                        Hi! I am a Munich based Data Scientist with a research background
                        in astrophysics and particle physics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am an experienced software developer with a preference for Python.
                        I currently work on exploring and applying state-of-the-art solutions
                        to real-life challenges in the fields of anomaly detection, physical
                        analytics, forecasting and digital twin simulations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from the University of Trieste (Italy) with a master's degree
                        in particle physics, I moved to the Technical University of Munich to pursue my
                        PhD in astrophysics. My main scientific interest was to investigate the origin of
                        astrophysical neutrinos using the data from the South Pole IceCube Neutrino
                        Observatory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently working as Data Scientist at OmegaLambdaTec, a company that provides
                        pioneering smart data solutions in the sectors of energy and smart cities.
                    </p>
